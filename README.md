# The Pursuit of-Hapi-ness

This repo holds the code examples for [a Node.js tutorial of the same name](https://medium.com/@_expr/the-pursuit-of-hapi-ness-d82777afaa4b), for both [Hapi.js v6.0](https://github.com/mwillerich/The-Pursuit-of-Hapi-ness/tree/master/Hapi6App), which was current at the time the tutorial was written, and [Hapi.js v8.0](https://github.com/mwillerich/The-Pursuit-of-Hapi-ness/tree/master/Hapi8App), which is the current version at the time this repo was created.

I have used the v8 version alongside a [presentation based on the tutorial](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17Iki3J9R3mMZ0MHI2dl9No49YD9szG0b4g4_l15IDh8/edit?usp=sharing)
